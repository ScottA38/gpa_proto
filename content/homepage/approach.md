The only constant in regulation of the insurance industry has been change. GPA Consulting has developed comprehensive modular audit scopes that are constantly enhanced to incorporate additional and amended regulatory requirements.

Our audit scopes are modular and can be reduced or even enhanced to meet your individual needs.

Your partner will receive ample notice of the audit and be provided with a summary of the audit process and a list of the key information required. In addition, we provide our expectations in relation to the people we will require access to, and an estimate of the time required with each.

All of our audits conclude with an exit meeting where any recommendations made will be discussed and any comments from your partner will be recorded and included in our report.

The format and delivery of our reports are individually agreed along with any service standard requirements.
